.TP
.BR \-\-long\-commands
Show full command lines without truncation. By default, commands are truncated

.TP
.B %CPU
CPU usage percentage

.TP
.B %MEM
Memory usage percentage  

.TP
.B RSS

.TP
.B START
Process start time:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
HH:MM for processes started within 24 hours
.IP \(bu 2
MonDD for processes started this calendar year  
.IP \(bu 2
YYYY for processes started in previous years
.RE

.TP
.B TIME
Cumulative CPU time:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\-\- for zero CPU time
.IP \(bu 2
HH:MM:SS for under 24 hours
.IP \(bu 2
XXXhrs for 24+ hours
.RE

.TP
.B COMMAND
Process command line with tree viz

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B COLUMNS
If set, overrides the detected terminal width for output formatting.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Display all processes in tree format:
.B proktree

.TP
Show only processes owned by current user:
.B proktree -u

.TP
Show processes owned by postgres user:
.B proktree -u postgres

.TP
Show process with PID 1234 and its tree:
.B proktree -p 1234

.TP
Find all Node.js processes:
.B proktree -s node

.TP
Find all processes containing "nginx" (case-insensitive):
.B proktree -i nginx

.TP
Show multiple users' processes:
.B proktree -u www-data -u nginx -u apache

.TP
Show full usernames and commands:
.B proktree --long-users --long-commands

.TP
Combine filters (shows processes matching any filter):
.B proktree -p 1234 -u postgres -s redis

.SH PLATFORM SUPPORT
proktree supports macOS and Linux. Platform-specific process information is
gathered using the native ps command.

.SH NOTES
proktree automatically filters out itself and any ps processes it spawns.

When multiple filters are specified, they are combined with OR logic - a process
tree is shown if it matches any of the specified filters.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred (e.g., failed to get process list)
